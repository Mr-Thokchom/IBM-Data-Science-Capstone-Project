# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-Project
##Project Background and context
  We predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will successfully land. Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against Space X for a rocket launch.
##Executive Summary of Methodology
1)Data collection methodology:
    --Via Space X Rest API
2)Through Web scrapping from Wikipedia
3)Perform data wrangling
4)One hot encoding and dropping irrelevant columns to perform Machine Learning Algorithms.
5)Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization and SQL
6)Perform interactive visual analytics using Folium and Plotly Dash
7)Perform predictive analysis using classification models
    --How to build, tune, evaluate classification models
