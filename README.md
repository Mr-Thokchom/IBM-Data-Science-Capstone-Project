# SpaceX Falcon9's prediction

We predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage bosster will successfully land or not. Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against Space X for a rocket launch.
